# Azure Function Resources

This folder is used to store Azure Function specific meta data and resources.

This folder is also used to allow the user to easily create a custom function-specific configuration, for exanmple in order to change the trigger settings.

To specify custom, 'Per Function' configuration json, just place the desired configuration file as 'functionname.json' into this folder (it does not matter if it is the PowerShell function name or the condensed version used for publishing on Azure).
