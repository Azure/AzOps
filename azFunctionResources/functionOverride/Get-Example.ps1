			This file will be used to override the auto-generated CLIENT MODULE function implementation.
		
			Using the vsts-createFunctionClientModule.ps1 task script, you can autogenerate a client module.
			That module can be used to connect to the published Azure Function Module.
			However sometimes you may want to override the default client function for a given command,
			in order to better customize the way it behaves.
		
			Creating a ps1 file with the name of the specific function in this folder will use this file,
			rather than creating a default copy.
		
			NOTE:
			There will be no further automatic change detection!
			If you later update the Azure Function, you need to manually update the client function as well.
