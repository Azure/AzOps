## Additional Notes

### Debugging AzOps in PowerShell

Modify the default output state path generated by the module.

```powershell
Set-PSFConfig -FullName AzOps.Core.State -Value "/tmp/azops"
```

Increase the verbosity of the logging messages.

```powershell
Set-PSFConfig PSFramework.Message.Info.Maximum 9
```

Increase the max retention count of log messages.

```powershell
Set-PSFConfig PSFramework.Logging.MaxMessageCount 1MB
```

### Debugging AzOps in VSCode

By default, setting breakpoints on AzOps in VS Code will not work.
This is due to the files being invoked as scriptblock by default, rather than as file, for performance reasons.
To work around this issue, set a configuration setting to disable thisbehavior:

```powershell
Set-PSFConfig AzOps.Import.DoDotSource $true
```

You can make it remember that by registering the setting:

```powershell
Set-PSFConfig AzOps.Import.DoDotSource $true -PassThru | Register-PSFConfig
```
