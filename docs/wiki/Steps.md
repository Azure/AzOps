* **Diff** *(from validate-deploy template/action)*  
  Validate if there have been any changes within Azure Resource Manager and the Git representation of the hierarchy.

* **Custom Sorting** *(from validate-deploy template/action)*  
  *Condition*: Only runs if variable `AZOPS_CUSTOM_SORT_ORDER` is `true`  
  Import all files from **Diff** step and check for a `.order` file in the same directory.  
  Rearrange files in the order specified in the `.order` file to be deployed before other files in the same directory.

* **Validate** *(from validate-deploy template/action)*

### Redeploy

Redeploy can be used to deploy a single template or all templates in a folder on-demand without the need for a pull request. This is useful in scenarios where a resource might have been changed outside the scope of AzOps and you want to redeploy the template to bring it back in line with the desired state. This can also be used when a push pipeline fails after a pull request changing several files has been merged and only one or a few files needs to be updated for the deployment to succeed. Create a new pull request with `[skip ci]` in the merge commit message to avoid the push pipeline from running and the run the redeploy pipeline manually after merge.

The redeploy pipeline is triggered manually and has a path parameter that is required. Supply the path to the template or folder that needs to be redeployed. The path is relative to the root of the repository.

* **Checkout**  
  This stage checkouts out the repository source code from the Source Control Platform to the CI/CD runner.

* **Get Latest AzOps version**
  Get latest version of AzOps module from the PowerShell Gallery. If variable `AZOPS_MODULE_VERSION` is set, use that version instead.

* **Cache AzOps module**
  Cache the AzOps module folder to not have to download dependencies on each run.

* **Dependencies**  
  Download and install AzOps, Az.Accounts, Az.Billing, Az.Resources and PSFramework modules.

* **Connect**  
  Authenticate the PowerShell session on the runner via Service Principal or Managed Identity.

* **Diff**  
  If the path parameter contains path to a folder, add all files in that path to diff, if the path parameter contains a path to a file, add that file to diff.

* **Deploy**  
  Push all templates included in diff to Azure Resource Manager
