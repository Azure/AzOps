## Windows

Enabling long paths on Windows
The Git clone below and AzOps GitHub Action implementation requires that you enable long paths in Windows. To enable this, execute the following command from a terminal with elevated privileges:

```
REG ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

You will also need to execute the following command line from an elevated terminal:

```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

Restart your computer to ensure changes take effect.
