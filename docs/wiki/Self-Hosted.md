# Self-hosted agents/runners

The AzOps pipelines/actions are running on Microsoft-hosted agents or GitHub Actions hosted virtual environments by default. Depending on your organizations security requirements you might want to use self-hosted agents/runners instead. The benefits of using self-hosted agents are:

- Possibility to use a Managed Identity instead of Service Principal
- Performance advantages - start and run builds faster
- Runtime isolation - no shared compute
- Possibility to deploy to internal resources using private endpoints
- Full control over network traffic

AzOps have full support for the use of self-hosted agents/runners and this article outlines the requirements needed.

For more information about using GitHub Actions self-hosted runners see, [About self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
For more information about using Azure DevOps self-hosted agents see, [Azure Pipelines agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser).

> ⚠️ In case of multiple agents/runners on the same compute resource ensure locking the `Validate` and `Push` pipelines to the same the agent/runner (e.g. using [demands with Azure Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/demands?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml))

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

Virtual Machine Scale Sets are optimal for hosting your self-hosted agents/runners. They are easy to create and manage and will automatically scale as resource demand changes. To learn more about Virtual Machine Scale Sets see, [Virtual Machine Scale Sets documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/).

## Image

To setup a VMSS for your self-hosted agents/runners you need an image with all the required software installed. The pipelines and actions provided in the [AzOps-Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps-Accelerator) repository are using the GitHub Actions Virtual Environments [`ubuntu-latest`](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/tree/main/images/linux) image by default. The images includes multiple tools and software including all AzOps requirements.

### Build an image using GitHub Actions Virtual Environments

If you want to use the same image as the hosted environments for your self-hosted agents/runners you can build an image following the guides in the [GitHub Actions Virtual Environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).

### Building your own custom image

If you want to build your own custom lightweight image the following software is required for AzOps to function properly.

#### Required software

AzOps have a couple of dependencies that are required to function properly. When building your custom image, make sure that the following tools are included in the image:

| Software | Note |
|:--|:--|
| `jq` | Minimum required version is `1.6` |
| `Git` | - |
| `PowerShell` | Minimum required version is `7.2` |
| `Azure CLI` | Required when using Azure DevOps |
| `Github CLI` | Required when using GitHub |
| `Bicep` | Required if you plan to deploy [Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) templates using AzOps |

##### PowerShell Modules

AzOps depends on some of the `Az` modules and `PSFramework`, these modules will be installed with `AzOps` during pipeline/action run and are not required to include in your image. But if you want to make your pipelines/actions as fast as possible the modules can be included in your image. To find the modules and the version required for the latest AzOps version see the [module manifest](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps/blob/main/src/AzOps.psd1#L54).

##### Azure CLI Extensions

AzOps are using the `az repos` command group which is a part of the `azure-devops` extension to manage pull requests. The extension should be included in the image if running AzOps on Azure DevOps.

| Extension |
|:--|
| `azure-devops` |
