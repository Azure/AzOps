### Introduction

The purpose of this wiki is to provide detailed information about **AzOps Resource Deletion**.

**AzOps Resource Deletion** performs deletion of role and policy assignments in Azure, based on `AzOps - Pull` generated templates at all Azure scope levels.


### Supported Actions

 - Deleting custom or built-in roleAssignments: When `Invoke-AzOpsPull` runs, it fetches the existing environment which includes custom and built-in roleAssignments. By removing the assignment file, roleAssignments at all Azure scope levels `(Management Group/Subscription/Resource Group)` can be managed from the repository directly.

 - Deleting custom or built-in policyAssignments: When `Invoke-AzOpsPull` runs, its fetches the existing environment which includes custom and built-in policyAssignments. By removing the assignment file, policyAssignments at all Azure scope levels `(Management Group/Subscription/Resource Group)` can be managed from the repository directly.

### How to use

Detailed steps:

1. Trigger the pull to fetch the fresh data of existing Azure environment. Navigate to Actions and run `AzOps - Pull`

2. It's recommended to capture the current stage either from `portal` or via any `script` to validate the behaviour after completion of the deletion.

3.Browse to the repository and to the `feature branch` and delete the Role or Policy assignment file or both which are required to be deleted.

4. Once file has been deleted from the branch, create pull request from `Feature Branch` to `Main Branch`.

![ResourceDeletion_Pull_Request_status](./Media/ResourceDeletion/ResourceDeletion_Pull_Request_status.PNG)

5. Once Pull Requested has been created, it will trigger the `AzOps - Validate` pipeline to do initial check. Wait for the pipeline to complete.

6. Now the `Approver` can review the pull request. It contains detailed information about which file to delete and pull request can be approved based on that.

7. With the approval, `AzOps - Push` pipeline will get triggered to apply/implement the requested changes.

8. Now the changes can be validated via `Portal` or `Script`

**_Please Note_**

- Resource Deletion is supported for templates generated by `AzOps - Pull` for resource type `roleAssignments` and `policyAssignments`.
- For any other resource type **deletion is not supported in AzOps at this time**.
- SPN used for deletion/change action, should have the below scope in its role definition.

    - For Azure Policy assignment removal
    ```bash
                Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/delete
                                        OR
                Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/*
                                        OR
                Microsoft.Authorization/* OR  * (For everything)
    ```
    - For Azure Role assignment removal
    ```bash
                Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete
                                        OR
                Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/*
                                        OR
                Microsoft.Authorization/* OR  * (For everything)
    ```

### Integration with AzOps Accelerator

The [AzOps Accelerator pipelines](https://github.com/azure/azops-accelerator) (including `Git Hub Actions` & `Azure Pipelines`) incorporates the execution of resource deletion.

Conditional logic has been implemented to call `Invoke-AzOpsPush` with required change set in case of resource deletion operation, while existing logic without resource deletion remains same.

### How to Add AzOps Resource Deletion to existing AzOps - Push and Validate pipelines (applicable to implementations created prior to AzOps release v1.6.0)

1. Update the `AzOps - Push` pipeline by copying content from the latest upstream [push.yml](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps-Accelerator/blob/main/.pipelines/push.yml) file into your existing file.
2. Update the `AzOps - Validate` pipeline by copying content from the latest upstream [validate.yml](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps-Accelerator/blob/main/.pipelines/validate.yml) file into your existing file.
